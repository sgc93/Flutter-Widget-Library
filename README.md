## Explored Widget Lists

1. **ListView** <br>
   In Flutter, the ListView widget provides several constructors that allow you to create scrollable lists of items. Here are the four main constructors of ListView along with their usage, syntax, and examples: <br>
   a. _ListView()_ <br>
      Usage: The *ListView* constructor creates a scrollable list of items. It's suitable for relatively small lists that can fit entirely on the screen. <br>
      Syntax:
      ```bash
      ListView(
         children: <Widget>[
            // List items go here
         ],
      )
      ```
      example:
   ```bash
   ListView(
     children: <Widget>[
       ListTile(title: Text('Item 1')),
       ListTile(title: Text('Item 2')),
       ListTile(title: Text('Item 3')),
     ],
   )
   ```
